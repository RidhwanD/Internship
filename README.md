# Internship
The code of my project during internship in PT. TMMIN (May 2017 - Jul 2017).

The source code in PHP is regarding the schedule management, while the source code in Java handles the schedule reminder via SMS. We use Gammu SMS Gateway to send and recieve message. However, those are not included in this repository.
